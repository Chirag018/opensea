Tech Stack: React, Tailwind CSS


This task was a bit tricky initially while seeing it at first, but after analyzing it, divided it into small-small components, found out to be an interesting one, this UI was a great one to check one's ability in UI / frontend development.

The task was to be completed using Tailwind CSS, at first I never knew Tailwind but it was the first time I was working with it, it is a very good UI framework for CSS, it is fast, compatible, easy to adapt.

The task was also to be done using Nextjs but had very little time and also I have never worked on Nextjs but just had a glance at its documentation, felt like it is easy and can be adapted fast. But due to time constraints thought of not taking risks to incompletion.

One of the main motives of the UI was also to make it responsive, using Tailwind for the first time I thought it would be the same as plain CSS, but it was way easier to do, but I messed up as I was a bit confused between some tags, then got the clarity about them by analyzing it properly. (80% done)

Finishing touches to be made:
1.15-20% responsiveness(Starting Page and notable drops only).
2. Some of the color tags are to be changed.
